    <h1 style="text-align: center;">What to Know About Different Types of Arrhythmias</h1>
    <p>When your heart’s normal, steady rhythm is disrupted and starts beating abnormally fast, slow, or in an irregular pattern, doctors call this condition an arrhythmia.

        There are several arrhythmia types. Some are temporary or relatively harmless. Others can lead to potentially severe complications if they’re not treated.
        
        This article will look at the different types of arrhythmias, what causes them, and how they’re typically treated.</p>
        <h2>What is an arrhythmia?</h2>
        <p>The rhythm of your heart is established by electrical impulses that follow the same route in and around your heart. These impulses begin in the sinoatrial (SA) node at the top of your heart. They then move through a network of fibers to all the chambers of your heart.

            This electrical pattern allows your heart’s chambers to pump out blood and then relax and fill with blood in a controlled sequence. It keeps blood flowing steadily throughout your body.
            
            Some heart rhythm changes are expected and even healthy, such as a faster heart rate during exercise. An arrhythmia, on the other hand, is any change to your heart’s electrical activity that causes an abnormal or unpredictable pattern of heartbeats.

            <h1>Normal</h1>
            <img align="right" src="https://th.bing.com/th?id=OIP.JroTnzUTm9VWSVgRUGDWWQHaIK&w=238&h=262&c=8&rs=1&qlt=90&o=6&dpr=1.3&pid=3.1&rm=2"  width="800" height="400">
            <p>Your pulse rate, also known as your heart rate, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. A normal resting heart rate should be between 60 to 100 beats per minute, but it can vary from minute to minute.</p>
            <p>For most adults, a resting heart rate should be between 60 bpm and 100 bpm. Having a high heart rate when you're not being active can be a sign of a problem. For example, having a heart rate over 120 while resting could point to an abnormal heart rhythm</p>
            <p>A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats per minute.</p>
            <p>o measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe. To check your pulse at your wrist, place two fingers between the bone and the tendon over your radial artery — which is located on the thumb side of your wrist.
            </p>
            <p>When you feel your pulse, count the number of beats in 15 seconds. Multiply this number by four to calculate your beats per minute.</p>

            <h1>Premature Atrial Contraction</h1>
            <img align="Right" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60b553829ae790f1371bfcf1/6275b5d4ae660a3f2df9c9ba_PAC_INTRO-min.png"  width="800" height="400">

            <p>Premature atrial contractions (PACs) are extra heartbeats that start in the upper chambers of your heart. When the premature, or early, signal tells the heart to contract, there may not be much blood in the heart at that moment. That means there’s not much blood to pump out. A pause and a strong beat may follow the extra heartbeat, making it feel like a skipped beat.

                A premature atrial contraction can feel like an extra beat when there’s more blood in the heart to pump than there is with a skipped beat.</p>
<p>If your premature atrial contractions happen often, your provider will look for a cause. However, the cause is sometimes unknown.</p>

   <h3> Causes may include:</h3>
    <ul>
    
    <li>A drop in the amount of blood going to your heart.</li>
    <li>Injury to your heart.</li>
    <li>A problem with your heart’s structure (like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).</li>
    <li>A problem with the amount of electrolytes or minerals (like potassium) in your body.</li>
    <h3>Causes you have some ability to manage include:</h3>
    
    <li>Tiredness.</li>
    <li> Caffeine intake.</li>
    <li> Alcohol intake.</li>
    <li>Smoking or using other tobacco products.</li>
    <li>Stress.
    <li>Some prescribed medications.</li>
    <li> Recreational drug use.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Premature Venticular contractions (PVCs)</h1>
    <img align="right" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60b553829ae790f1371bfcf1/6274177c97ad38571bdcf02d_PVC_INTRO-min.png"  width="800" height="400">
    <p>Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra heartbeats that begin in one of the heart's two lower pumping chambers (ventricles). These extra beats disrupt the regular heart rhythm, sometimes causing a sensation of a fluttering or a skipped beat in the chest.

        Premature ventricular contractions are a common type of irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are also called:
        <ul>
        <li>Premature ventricular complexes</li>
        <li>Ventricular premature beats</li>
        <li>Ventricular extrasystoles</li>
        </ul>
        Occasional premature ventricular contractions in people without heart disease usually aren't a concern and likely don't need treatment. You might need treatment if the premature ventricular contractions are very frequent or bothersome, or if you have an underlying heart condition. 
        To understand the cause of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), it might help to learn more about how the heart typically beats.

The heart is made of four chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).

The heart's rhythm is controlled by a natural pacemaker (the sinus node) in the right upper chamber (atrium). The sinus node sends electrical signals that typically start each heartbeat. These electrical signals move across the atria, causing the heart muscles to squeeze (contract) and pump blood into the ventricles.</p>

<h2>Ventricular Fibrillation</h2>
<img align="right"src="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/-/scassets/images/org/health/articles/21878-ventricular-fibrillation-illustration"  width="400" height="300">
<p>Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death.

    Emergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Medications, implanted devices or surgery may be recommended to prevent episodes of ventricular fibrillation.
    
    Ventricular fibrillation may also be called VFib, V-fib or VF.</p>
    <p>In a typical heart rhythm, electrical signals travel from the heart's upper chambers (atria) to the heart's lower chambers (ventricles), causing the ventricles to contract and pump blood. In ventricular fibrillation, rapid, irregular electrical signals cause the ventricles to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood.

        Sometimes, the cause of ventricular fibrillation is unknown.
        
        To understand more about how ventricular fibrillation occurs, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats.</p>
